##Description
This program contains two windows. 

First and main window shows stats for all champions. 
The center is reserved for images of heroes who are represented and based on carousel design which is used for selecting champion that you want to look at.
Right and left corners of the first window contains "spider" charts that shows average stats for all heroes combined (white color), and stats for the selected hero (green color). In the middle of the bottom there is a bar chart that shows the statistics of the selected hero and another 10 heroes that are approximately close in some branches of the statistic.
In the middle, there is a drop-down menu that contains filters for most kills per game, assists, minions, gold etc. In the top left corner there is drop-down menu for regions (EUNE, BR, EUW, KR, LAN, LAS, NA, OC, RU, TR and all combined).
Finally, at the top of the screen there is a button that leads us to the second window.

Second window contains a map of the world with the most notable heroes during ultra rapid fire mode. When you hover over heroes siluete it shows some interesting stats and a little something about heroes background. Shaco you will find more difficult to catch since he was more difficult to catch during this mode :)
